[Urgent]
3 - SOLVED:
    Curriculum page is a god damn mess. I have no idea why. Found 2024/04/24.
    File: curriculum.html.
        FIXED 2024-04-25
        Conflicting margin/padding data caused by the general style.css file. 
        Fixed by overriding margin data in the curriculum.css file.
4 - SOLVED:
    findus.html is broken on mobile due to an issue with how its css file handles,
    or rather doesn't handle, the smaller article.
    File: findus.html. Found 2024/04/25. 
        FIXED 2024-04-25
        It was a problem with the image icons mixed with what I set the minimum font size to.
        Added new query to finduss.css that appends word-break: break-all; to the article
        element when the screen width is below a certain threshold. This isn't great,
        but this took me way too long to figure out and I'm tired of looking at it.

Nothing to report - happy days!

1 - "SOLVED":
    Header flexbox not working as expected on index.html on "inbetween" screen sizes.
    File: index.html, found 2024/04/22.
        FIXED 2024-04-25
        Fixed by adding a new query to header-style.css which adjusts the margin if we're under a certain screen width.
        This is kind of a janky solution but it works for now. Might revisit later. Don't know.

[Low]
2 - UNSOLVED:
    Not necessarily a bug, but we're not practicing good development habits. Class names are nonsensical,
    and we're not using semantic HTML. This will need to be fixed before the final submission.
    File: All. "Found" 2024/04/22.
