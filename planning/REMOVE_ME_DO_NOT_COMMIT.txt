SERIAL PORT USAGE GUIDELINES
============================
1. Parse the data from the serial port and store it in a buffer unless divine, see Appendix A.
2. Use the buffer to process the data. The data consists of big endian 16-bit integers.
3. The data is in the form of a 16-bit integer followed by a newline character. The newline character is the delimiter.
4. Be aware that the data may be corrupted or incomplete. If the data is corrupted or incomplete, discard the data and continue parsing.
5. Corruption may occur if the data is not in the form of a 16-bit integer followed by a newline character.
6. It can be repaired by using the TELQ library. The TELQ library is a library that can be used to repair corrupted data.
7. The TELQ library is a third-party library. It is not included in the project. It must be downloaded and installed separately.
8. The TELQ library is not free. It is a paid library. It is not included in the project budget. It must be purchased separately.
9. The TELQ library is not open source. It is a proprietary library. It is not included in the project. It must be purchased separately.
